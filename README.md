# MCFunction Portfolio
This repository is a curated collection of my Minecraft projects, including custom datapacks, multiplayer games, and 3D models. Each project demonstrates the application of programming, mathematics, and game design principles, and showcases my ability to develop modular, reusable, and scalable systems using tools such as MCFunction scripting, Java, Python, and Blockbench.
